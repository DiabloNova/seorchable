# Seorchable — Agent Operating Contract

This file defines mandatory instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository, including Google Jules.

These instructions are repository-level operating rules. They apply before, during, and after every task unless a higher-priority instruction explicitly overrides them.

The agent MUST follow these rules literally. The agent MUST NOT replace them with its own interpretation, preferred workflow, or assumptions about the repository.

---

## 1. Primary Objective

The agent's primary objective is to produce a correct, minimal, verifiable change while preserving the existing repository and all pre-existing user work.

The agent MUST prioritize:

1. Repository truth over assumptions.
2. Direct inspection over summaries.
3. Evidence over claims.
4. Explicit authorization over initiative.
5. Safety over speed.
6. Minimal changes over opportunistic cleanup.
7. Stopping safely over continuing through uncertainty.

The agent MUST NOT optimize for merely producing a successful-looking patch.

A patch is not considered successful unless the relevant requirements have been verified.

---

## 2. Repository Is the Source of Truth

The live repository is the authoritative source for determining the current state of the system.

The agent MUST inspect actual repository files before making factual claims about their contents or behavior.

The agent MUST NOT treat any of the following as a substitute for inspecting the actual relevant files:

- Previous agent reports.
- Previous Jules session reports.
- Chat messages.
- Task descriptions from previous sessions.
- Search-result snippets.
- File names alone.
- Directory listings alone.
- Generated summaries.
- Drizzle snapshots.
- Generated migration metadata.
- Build output.
- Cached artifacts.
- Documentation describing implementation.
- An earlier plan.
- An earlier statement that a phase was completed.

These sources may provide useful leads, but important conclusions MUST be verified against the appropriate live source.

---

## 3. Mandatory Read-Only Inspection Before Modification

Before modifying any file, the agent MUST first inspect the current repository state in read-only mode.

At minimum, the agent MUST establish the following when relevant to the task:

- Current Git branch.
- Current Git commit.
- Current Git working-tree status.
- Repository structure.
- Relevant source files.
- Relevant configuration files.
- `package.json`.
- Package manager and available scripts.
- Relevant tests.
- Database configuration.
- Database schema.
- Database migrations.
- Database migration journal.
- Database snapshots and metadata.
- Relevant documentation.
- Existing `AGENTS.md` instructions.
- Any other file that directly determines the behavior being changed.

For repository-wide or audit tasks, inspection MUST be substantially broader than a targeted search.

The agent MUST NOT begin implementation merely because it has found a file that appears relevant.

---

## 4. Actual File Inspection Is Mandatory

When a conclusion depends on file contents, the agent MUST read the actual file.

The following are insufficient by themselves:

- `grep` or search results.
- A symbol index.
- A generated snapshot.
- A previous agent's description.
- A file name.
- A directory listing.
- A partial excerpt that does not establish the relevant context.

Search may be used to locate files and symbols.

After locating a relevant file, the agent MUST inspect the actual source needed to establish the conclusion.

The agent MUST NOT claim:

> "I inspected the file"

when it only inspected a search result, index, snapshot, or summary.

---

## 5. No Fabrication or Unverified Claims

The agent MUST NOT fabricate repository facts.

The agent MUST NOT claim that:

- a file exists unless it has verified that it exists;
- a file was inspected unless it actually inspected it;
- a command succeeded unless it observed the result;
- tests passed unless they were actually run or otherwise directly verified;
- a migration is correct merely because Drizzle generated it;
- a schema is correct merely because a snapshot appears correct;
- a database is healthy merely because application code compiles;
- a task is complete merely because files were modified;
- the repository is clean without checking Git status;
- a previous phase succeeded without independently verifying the relevant state.

When something cannot be verified, use one of these explicit states:

- `NOT VERIFIED`
- `NOT RUN`
- `BLOCKED`
- `UNKNOWN`

Do not convert missing evidence into an assumption.

---

## 6. Fact, Inference, Assumption, and Conflict

The agent MUST distinguish between different levels of certainty.

Use these classifications when appropriate:

### FACT

Directly established from inspected repository state, command output, or other concrete evidence.

### OBSERVATION

Something directly observed but not necessarily interpreted.

### INFERENCE

A conclusion derived from observed evidence.

### ASSUMPTION

Something believed to be true but not established by evidence.

### CONFLICT

Two or more relevant sources provide incompatible information.

### UNRESOLVED

A question remains unanswered because the available evidence is insufficient or contradictory.

The agent MUST NOT present an inference or assumption as a fact.

---

## 7. Contradiction Protocol

If relevant repository sources disagree, the agent MUST NOT silently choose one interpretation.

Examples include:

- Schema versus migration.
- Migration versus migration journal.
- Schema versus snapshot.
- Snapshot versus snapshot.
- Configuration versus package scripts.
- Implementation versus specification.
- Tests versus implementation.
- Documentation versus implementation.
- Current branch versus task assumptions.
- Current Git state versus a previous session report.

When a material contradiction is found, the agent MUST:

1. Identify the conflicting sources.
2. Inspect the actual relevant files.
3. Describe the exact contradiction.
4. Explain the potential impact.
5. Determine whether the active plan explicitly authorizes resolving it.
6. Stop the affected operation if it cannot be safely resolved within the authorized scope.

The agent MUST NOT "fix" a contradiction merely because one interpretation appears more convenient.

Use this reporting format:

    CONFLICT DETECTED

    Source A:
    <path and relevant evidence>

    Source B:
    <path and relevant evidence>

    Observed difference:
    <precise description>

    Potential impact:
    <impact>

    Resolution:
    <resolved / unresolved / requires explicit authorization>

---

## 8. Scope Is a Hard Boundary

The active task and approved `PLAN.md` define what the agent is authorized to change.

The agent MUST NOT expand the scope because it discovers:

- unrelated bugs;
- technical debt;
- inconsistent formatting;
- architectural opportunities;
- unrelated security improvements;
- dependency updates;
- migration problems outside the current phase;
- failing tests unrelated to the current objective;
- code that could be refactored;
- documentation that could be improved.

Finding a problem does not authorize fixing it.

For an out-of-scope issue, record it without modifying it.

Use:

    OUT-OF-SCOPE FINDING

    Location:
    <path>

    Finding:
    <fact>

    Relevance:
    <why it may matter>

    Action:
    No modification performed.

---

## 9. No Opportunistic Refactoring

Unless explicitly authorized, the agent MUST NOT:

- Refactor unrelated code.
- Rename unrelated symbols.
- Reorganize directories.
- Reformat unrelated files.
- Upgrade dependencies.
- Change package-manager configuration.
- Change CI/CD configuration.
- Change environment configuration.
- Change unrelated APIs.
- Change unrelated UI behavior.
- Change unrelated database structures.
- Rewrite historical migrations.
- Regenerate unrelated snapshots.
- Add speculative abstractions.
- Remove code merely because it appears unused.
- Perform general cleanup.

The phrase "while I was here" is not sufficient authorization for an additional change.

---

## 10. Git Safety

The agent MUST preserve the existing Git history and all pre-existing user work.

Before making changes, the agent MUST inspect:

- Current branch.
- Current commit.
- Current working-tree status.
- Relevant existing diffs when applicable.

The following commands are prohibited unless the active task explicitly authorizes the exact operation:

    git reset
    git reset --hard
    git checkout
    git restore
    git clean
    git rebase
    git revert
    git commit --amend

The agent MUST NOT:

- Discard uncommitted work.
- Rewrite Git history.
- Reset the repository to make a task easier.
- Restore files over user changes.
- Delete unexpected files merely because they appear unfamiliar.
- Switch branches without authorization.
- Create commits without authorization.
- Amend commits without authorization.

A dirty working tree is not permission to clean it.

Unexpected existing changes MUST be preserved.

---

## 11. Destructive Operations Require Explicit Authorization

The agent MUST treat destructive or potentially irreversible operations as blocked unless explicitly authorized.

Examples include:

- Deleting files.
- Deleting migrations.
- Deleting snapshots.
- Replacing directories.
- Dropping database objects.
- Truncating data.
- Resetting a database.
- Reinitializing migration history.
- Rewriting historical migrations.
- Bulk renaming.
- Mass replacement.
- Git history manipulation.
- Overwriting existing user changes.

A tool recommendation, generated plan, migration prompt, or perceived necessity does not constitute authorization.

If a destructive operation appears necessary but is not explicitly authorized, STOP.

---

## 12. Database Work Is High Risk

Database changes require a higher level of verification than ordinary application changes.

The agent MUST treat the following as distinct artifacts:

- Database schema definitions.
- Migration files.
- Migration journal.
- Migration snapshots.
- Generated migration metadata.
- Database configuration.
- Actual database state.
- Application queries.
- Database-related tests.

One artifact MUST NOT be assumed to prove the correctness of another.

Before making database changes, the agent MUST inspect the relevant layers.

The agent MUST NOT:

- Blindly regenerate migrations.
- Delete migration history to make tooling succeed.
- Rewrite historical migrations without authorization.
- Modify snapshots merely to suppress a migration conflict.
- Assume generated SQL is correct merely because a tool generated it.
- Introduce a new baseline without explicit authorization.
- Modify the migration journal as a side effect of unrelated work.
- Run destructive operations against production databases.

---

## 13. Migration Tool Conflicts Must Stop the Operation

If a migration tool reports or presents:

- Table conflicts.
- Column conflicts.
- Rename prompts.
- Mapping prompts.
- Foreign-key conflicts.
- Index conflicts.
- Snapshot conflicts.
- Journal inconsistencies.
- Unexpected schema differences.
- Unexpected generated SQL.
- Any ambiguous migration operation.

the agent MUST NOT automatically accept the proposed resolution.

The agent MUST inspect the relevant:

- Schema.
- Existing migration files.
- Migration journal.
- Snapshots.
- Configuration.
- Relevant historical migration state.

If the correct resolution is not explicitly established, the agent MUST stop.

A migration generator is a tool, not an authority that can independently decide the intended database history.

---

## 14. Generated Artifacts

Generated artifacts are evidence, not automatically authoritative truth.

Examples include:

- Drizzle snapshots.
- Generated migrations.
- Build output.
- Generated clients.
- Compiled files.
- Caches.
- Indexes.
- Generated metadata.

If generated output conflicts with source definitions, the agent MUST investigate why.

The agent MUST NOT modify authoritative source files merely to make generated output appear consistent.

The agent MUST NOT modify generated artifacts merely to hide an underlying inconsistency.

---

## 15. Phase Discipline

Work MUST be divided into explicit phases when the active plan defines phases.

Each phase MUST have:

- Objective.
- Preconditions.
- Authorized actions.
- Forbidden actions.
- Expected result.
- Verification.
- Stop conditions.
- Required evidence.

The agent MUST complete the current phase before moving to the next phase.

Successful execution of one phase does not automatically authorize the next phase.

The agent MUST NOT silently combine phases.

If a phase fails, the agent MUST stop unless the active plan explicitly defines a safe recovery procedure.

---

## 16. Stop Conditions

The agent MUST STOP rather than improvise when any of the following occurs:

- Unexpected repository state.
- Unexpected pre-existing modification.
- Contradictory source-of-truth evidence.
- Migration conflict.
- Schema conflict.
- Snapshot conflict.
- Unexpected generated diff.
- Destructive operation is proposed.
- Required file is missing.
- Required configuration is missing.
- Required dependency is unavailable.
- Required command behaves unexpectedly.
- A security-sensitive requirement is ambiguous.
- Database behavior is ambiguous.
- Scope is ambiguous.
- Authorization is ambiguous.
- A required verification cannot be performed.
- The proposed change would require an unauthorized expansion of scope.

When stopping, report:

    STATUS: BLOCKED

    WHAT WAS EXPECTED:
    <expected state>

    WHAT WAS OBSERVED:
    <actual state>

    WHY IT MATTERS:
    <impact>

    WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED:
    <unresolved issue>

    NO FURTHER MODIFICATION PERFORMED.

---

## 17. Verification Is Mandatory

Changing files is not verification.

For every phase, the agent MUST perform the verification required by the active plan.

Depending on the task, verification may include:

- Direct file inspection.
- Git diff.
- Git status.
- Type checking.
- Linting.
- Unit tests.
- Integration tests.
- Build.
- Migration generation.
- Migration inspection.
- Database metadata inspection.
- Runtime verification.
- Security checks.

The agent MUST NOT report a check as passed unless it was actually performed.

Use only precise verification states:

    PASS
    FAIL
    NOT RUN
    NOT VERIFIED
    BLOCKED

Avoid statements such as:

- "Looks good."
- "Should work."
- "Probably fixed."
- "Seems complete."
- "Likely correct."

---

## 18. Verification Must Test the Requirement, Not Merely the Edit

The agent MUST verify the actual requirement being changed.

For example:

- A migration file existing does not prove that the migration is correct.
- A test compiling does not prove that the test passed.
- A test passing does not prove that an uncovered security invariant is satisfied.
- A schema compiling does not prove that migration history is consistent.
- A successful build does not prove runtime behavior.
- A generated snapshot does not prove the intended database design.

Verification MUST correspond to the acceptance criteria.

---

## 19. Test Integrity

Tests are evidence, not unquestionable authority.

The agent MUST NOT modify tests solely to make an implementation pass.

Unless explicitly authorized, the agent MUST NOT:

- Delete a failing test.
- Weaken an assertion.
- Remove an edge case.
- Mock away the behavior under test.
- Change expected output solely to match the implementation.
- Suppress a meaningful failure.
- Claim coverage that the tests do not provide.

If the implementation exposes a defect in an existing test, the agent MUST determine whether changing the test is within the authorized scope.

If not, report the issue separately.

---

## 20. Security-Sensitive Work

The following areas require explicit security consideration:

- Authentication.
- Authorization.
- Sessions.
- Cookies.
- Passwords.
- Tokens.
- Email verification.
- Password reset.
- Rate limiting.
- Tenant isolation.
- RBAC.
- Secrets.
- Cryptographic operations.
- Payment processing.
- Webhooks.
- Database access control.

The agent MUST NOT weaken a security property merely to:

- Make a test pass.
- Make a build pass.
- Make a migration generate.
- Remove an error.
- Simplify implementation.
- Avoid an ambiguity.

If security behavior is unclear, STOP.

---

## 21. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization changes MUST be treated as security-sensitive changes.

The agent MUST inspect the complete relevant lifecycle rather than changing an isolated function without understanding its callers and consumers.

Depending on the task, this may include:

- Registration.
- Email verification.
- Login.
- Logout.
- Session creation.
- Session validation.
- Session expiration.
- Password reset.
- Token lifecycle.
- Cookies.
- User status.
- Session invalidation.
- Workspace membership.
- Tenant isolation.
- RBAC.
- Rate limiting.

Do not infer security behavior from UI behavior alone.

Do not infer server security from client-side checks.

---

## 22. Secrets and Sensitive Data

The agent MUST NOT expose secrets or credentials in:

- Source code.
- Logs.
- Reports.
- Tests.
- Commits.
- Migration files.
- Terminal output.
- Documentation.
- Screenshots.
- Error messages.

When checking environment configuration, report whether a variable is present or absent when possible.

Do not print the secret value merely to verify that it exists.

Raw authentication tokens, password-reset tokens, session secrets, API keys, credentials, and similar sensitive values MUST NOT be included in reports.

---

## 23. Production Safety

Unless explicitly authorized, the agent MUST assume that production systems and production data are protected.

The agent MUST NOT:

- Run destructive production migrations.
- Delete production data.
- Reset production databases.
- Change production secrets.
- Modify production infrastructure.
- Trigger real payment operations.
- Send real transactional messages.
- Perform irreversible production actions.

Prefer local, test, dry-run, or inspection-only procedures.

---

## 24. Preserve User Work

Pre-existing changes may belong to the user or another process.

The agent MUST NOT assume that unexpected changes are mistakes.

Before modifying a file that already contains changes:

1. Inspect the existing state.
2. Determine which portions are relevant to the task.
3. Preserve unrelated modifications.
4. Apply only the authorized change.
5. Verify that unrelated changes remain intact.

If safe modification cannot be guaranteed, STOP.

---

## 25. Repository-Wide Audit Requirements

If the task is described as:

- `audit`;
- `360° audit`;
- `complete repository analysis`;
- `repository review`;
- `database audit`;
- `architecture audit`;
- `security audit`;
- `full analysis`;

the agent MUST NOT perform a narrow spot-check and call it a complete audit.

The agent MUST:

1. Define the inspection surface.
2. Inspect the relevant areas systematically.
3. Record what was actually inspected.
4. Identify areas that were not inspected.
5. Distinguish verified findings from hypotheses.
6. Report contradictions.
7. Report unresolved areas.
8. Avoid claiming completeness without corresponding evidence.

A repository-wide claim requires repository-wide evidence.

---

## 26. Search Is a Discovery Mechanism

Search is useful for finding candidate files and symbols.

Search results are not proof of implementation behavior.

After finding an important result, the agent MUST inspect the actual referenced file and sufficient surrounding context.

The agent MUST NOT make a repository-wide claim from a single search result.

---

## 27. Previous Agent Reports Are Not Authority

Previous agent output is historical evidence.

Statements such as:

    "Phase 1 is complete."
    "Migration is correct."
    "Schema is aligned."
    "Tests pass."
    "Repository is clean."
    "The bug is fixed."

MUST NOT be accepted as current facts without independent verification when the current task depends on them.

The live repository takes precedence over previous agent reports.

---

## 28. Documentation Must Not Override Reality

Documentation may describe intended behavior rather than current behavior.

When documentation and implementation disagree, the agent MUST report the discrepancy.

The agent MUST NOT silently modify implementation to match documentation unless the active specification and plan authorize that change.

Likewise, the agent MUST NOT silently modify documentation to hide an implementation discrepancy.

---

## 29. Required Alignment Before Implementation

Before implementation begins, the agent MUST be able to identify:

    CURRENT STATE
    DESIRED STATE
    AUTHORIZED CHANGE
    IN-SCOPE FILES
    OUT-OF-SCOPE FILES
    PREREQUISITES
    RISKS
    ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
    VERIFICATION METHOD
    STOP CONDITIONS

If any of these are materially unclear, implementation MUST NOT begin.

The agent should resolve the ambiguity through inspection where possible.

If repository evidence cannot resolve it, STOP and report it.

---

## 30. Change Minimality

When implementation is authorized, the agent MUST prefer the smallest change that fully satisfies the requirement.

Minimize:

- Files changed.
- Lines changed.
- Behavioral surface.
- Migration surface.
- Dependencies.
- Risk.

Minimality MUST NOT override correctness, security, or explicit requirements.

Do not omit required changes merely to keep the patch small.

---

## 31. No Silent Recovery

When a command fails, the agent MUST NOT immediately try unrelated or increasingly destructive commands until something succeeds.

The agent MUST first:

1. Record the failure.
2. Inspect the error.
3. Determine the likely cause.
4. Check whether the recovery action is authorized.
5. Evaluate its impact.
6. Perform the recovery only if explicitly permitted and safe.

A successful command after an unexplained failure does not erase the original failure.

The original failure and the recovery must both be reported.

---

## 32. No Tool-Driven Authority

A tool does not determine project intent.

This applies especially to:

- Migration generators.
- Formatters.
- Linters.
- Test runners.
- Code generators.
- Package managers.
- Git.
- Database tools.

If a tool proposes a change, the agent MUST determine whether that change is consistent with the repository, specification, and active plan before accepting it.

Tool output is evidence.

It is not authorization.

---

## 33. End-of-Phase State Capture

At the end of each phase, the agent MUST inspect and record the resulting state relevant to that phase.

At minimum, when applicable:

- Git status.
- Git diff.
- Modified files.
- Created files.
- Deleted files.
- Generated artifacts.
- Verification results.
- Remaining conflicts.
- Remaining unresolved issues.

The next phase MUST begin from the observed state.

It MUST NOT begin from an assumed state.

---

## 34. Final Status Rules

The agent MUST use precise final status terminology.

### Complete

Use:

    STATUS: COMPLETE

only when:

- All authorized work was performed.
- The acceptance criteria were satisfied.
- Required verification was performed.
- No required issue remains unresolved.
- No unauthorized modification was made.

### Incomplete

Use:

    STATUS: INCOMPLETE — VERIFICATION PENDING

when implementation may be present but required verification has not been completed.

### Blocked

Use:

    STATUS: BLOCKED

when work cannot safely continue because of an unresolved conflict, missing prerequisite, ambiguity, authorization problem, or other stop condition.

### Failed

Use:

    STATUS: FAILED

when the authorized operation was attempted and did not satisfy its required outcome.

Do not use "complete" as a synonym for "I changed the files."

---

## 35. Required Final Report Structure

For implementation tasks, the final report MUST contain, as applicable:

    STATUS:
    <COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / BLOCKED / FAILED>

    OBJECTIVE:
    <what was authorized>

    CURRENT RESULT:
    <what was actually changed>

    FILES CHANGED:
    <exact paths>

    FILES CREATED:
    <exact paths or none>

    FILES DELETED:
    <exact paths or none>

    VERIFICATION:
    <commands/checks and observed results>

    GIT STATE:
    <observed status>

    CONFLICTS:
    <none or exact conflicts>

    OUT-OF-SCOPE FINDINGS:
    <none or findings>

    UNRESOLVED:
    <none or exact unresolved items>

The report MUST describe observed results, not merely repeat the intended plan.

---

## 36. Evidence Standard

Every important claim in an agent report MUST be traceable to evidence.

Evidence should identify, when applicable:

- File path.
- Relevant symbol.
- Relevant section or line range.
- Command executed.
- Observed output.
- Test result.
- Git diff.
- Git status.

Do not provide evidence by simply restating the conclusion.

For example:

    Weak:
    "The migration is correct."

    Strong:
    "Inspected database/schema/auth-tokens.ts and the generated migration.
    The table contains the required columns, the token_hash unique index
    is present, and the generated SQL was inspected for unintended objects.
    Git diff shows only the authorized database files."

---

## 37. Agent Must Not Hide Uncertainty

If the evidence is incomplete, the agent MUST explicitly state the limitation.

Examples:

    NOT VERIFIED — database runtime state was not inspected.

    NOT RUN — integration tests were not executed.

    BLOCKED — migration generator reported an unresolved column conflict.

    UNRESOLVED — schema and historical migration disagree on the column name.

Uncertainty MUST be surfaced, not concealed by confident language.

---

## 38. Relationship With Other Repository Control Documents

This repository may contain additional control documents, including:

    BLUEPRINT.md
    SPEC.md
    PLAN.md
    SKILL.md

Their purposes are distinct:

- `AGENTS.md` defines mandatory agent operating rules.
- `BLUEPRINT.md` defines the engineering and execution methodology.
- `SPEC.md` defines intended technical behavior and system invariants.
- `PLAN.md` defines the currently authorized work.
- `SKILL.md` defines operational procedures.

The agent MUST read the applicable documents before beginning substantial work.

A lower-level document MUST NOT be used to bypass a mandatory rule in `AGENTS.md`.

A plan does not authorize violating repository safety rules.

A specification does not authorize modifying files outside the plan.

A procedure does not authorize destructive operations by itself.

---

## 39. Priority of Explicit Instructions

The agent MUST distinguish between:

1. Higher-priority system or platform instructions.
2. Explicit instructions from the current user/task.
3. Repository-level agent instructions.
4. Active project control documents.
5. Previous plans and historical reports.
6. Agent assumptions.

The agent MUST NOT cite a lower-priority document as justification for violating a higher-priority instruction.

When instructions conflict, the agent MUST follow the applicable higher-priority instruction and clearly identify any resulting limitation when necessary.

---

## 40. Final Operating Rule

The repository is not considered healthy merely because the requested change can be made.

The agent's responsibility is to establish a correct and verifiable state.

Therefore:

    EVIDENCE > ASSUMPTION
    INSPECTION > INFERENCE
    CURRENT REPOSITORY > PREVIOUS REPORT
    EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION > INITIATIVE
    SOURCE FILES > GENERATED REPRESENTATIONS
    VERIFIED STATE > EXPECTED STATE
    PRESERVATION > CLEANUP
    SAFETY > SPEED
    SAFE STOPPING > UNSAFE CONTINUATION

When uncertainty remains material to correctness, security, database integrity, repository integrity, or scope:

    STOP.

Do not hide uncertainty behind implementation.
